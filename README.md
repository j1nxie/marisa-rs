![Marisa Kirisame](marisa-kirisame.gif)

a CHIP-8 emulator, with learning purposes in mind, written in Rust.

this is mainly a learning project of mine for deeper knowledge in emulator
development, so i can better implement my other project,
[sayaka-rs](https://github.com/j1nxie/sayaka-rs/).

the project image is an animated image of a Marisa Kirisame fumo. the Marisa
Kirisame character, also this project's namesake, belongs to the Touhou Project.
